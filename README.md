Abstract
Background
Evidence links immune-inflammatory/metabolic indicators with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in diabetes. This study used machine learning to construct a model of immunometabolic comprehensive indicator (IMCI), which may serve as a better predictor of mortality and cardiovascular disease in diabetes patients.
Methodology
This study included 3,355 diabetic patients from the 2001-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and constructed an IMCI by using machine learning. The study employed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, time-dependent ROC curves, Cox proportional hazards model, binary logistic regression analyses, and restricted cubic splines (RCS) to analyze the relationship between the IMCI and cardiovascular disease as well as its mortality. The findings were validated using the UK Biobank database.
Findings
In this study, the IMCI was significantly associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes. In the multivariable adjusted model, compared to participants with a lower IMCI, those with a higher IMCI had a significantly higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Time dependent ROC curve shows that IMCI has a good predictive effect on short-term and long-term mortality of diabetes patients. Moreover, RCS analysis shows that IMCI of diabetes patients is linear with all-cause mortality, but nonlinear with cardiovascular mortality. IMCI was significantly correlated with various CVDs, and these relationships were linear. Additionally, IMCI has the highest risk stratification capability for congestive heart failure. These results were externally validated by using the UK Biobank database, which yielded the same conclusions.
Conclusion 
The IMCI enhance mortality prediction, diagnostic efficacy of CVD and its mortality, and surpasses other currently prominent indicators in certain correlations with specific cardiovascular conditions. It is expected to become more effective metrics for identifying populations at early risk of cardiovascular disease and improve risk stratification.
